# Vim Configuration
## 
1. *(required)* Vim 8.0 or higher - This config is based on the latest features released in version 8.0+. It also makes use of **Native Packages** for managing plugins which are not present in earlier versions.
2. *(optional)* NeoVim - This configuration was designed for use within NeoVim and takes advantage of some of it's unique features, but will work just fine with a normal Vim installation. The NeoVim specific configurations will be bypased when running normal Vim.
